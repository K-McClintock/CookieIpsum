### Introduction
This project was born of necessity, because I was making a fake cookie company website and wanted matching ipsum text. It does stray into hipster lingo, but I expect nothing less from a (fake) indie cookie company putting flavor over corporate values. I designed the cookies in the logo as well.


### Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript/ECMAScript 6
* Procreate/Photoshop


### Project Status
This project is closed, unless I think of more words to throw in there.
